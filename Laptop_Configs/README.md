# Clover Laptop Configs and Hotpatches 2.0
>Based on [**Clover Laptop Config Repo**](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Clover-Laptop-Config) by Rehabman. All credits go to him!
>
>**DISCLAIMER**: This is my attempt to update Rehabman's existing Laptop configs for the new Clover version. I can't guarentee that all the configs work immediately since I do not possess a Laptop of every generation to test it.  

## About
This project contains `config.plist` files for common Laptops with Intel CPUs and Graphics. It's an updated version of Clover Laptop Config plists by Rehabman. All configs have been updated and conform to the new Clover with OpenCore's OpenRuntime integration in the form of Quirks (for Clover r5123 and newer).

To understand and modify the included config.plists, please refer to these accompanying Guides by Rehabman:

- [Booting the macOS Installer on Laptops with Clover](http://www.tonymacx86.com/el-capitan-laptop-support/148093-guide-booting-os-x-installer-laptops-clover.html)
- [Using Clover to "hotpatch" ACPI](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-using-clover-to-hotpatch-acpi.200137). Included in this package are some handy SSDTs for use with Clover ACPI hotpatching. If you understand ACPI, you may find the SSDTs (in conjunction with additional plists with patches) quite ueseful.

### Config Conversion Notes
In order to make these configs compatible with the latest Clover release (r5141), I had to change the following things:

- Validated configs with Clover Config Plist Validator (CCPV) to find conflicts
- Put `#` in front of Comments where they are not supported to avoid errors in CCPV
- Removed deprecated Keys like `DropOEM_DSM`
- Commented-out `#DropTables`. Enable if needed
- Deleted `ACPI` > `DropTables` > `DMAR` → covered by `DisableIoMapper` Quirk
- Deleted `ACPI` > `DropTables` > `MCFG` → covered by `FixMCFG` 
- Added Quirks for 2nd to 9th Gen Intel CPUs

## Brief description of included SSDT Hotpatches

| SSDT-…        | DESCRIPTION |
|:-------------:|-------------|
|**RMCF**|Rehabman Configuration File. This file provides configuration data for other SSDTs. Read the comments within the file for more information.|
|**RMDT**|Adds `RMDT` (RehabMan Debug Trace) device. This SSDT is for use with `ACPIDebug.kext`. Instead of patching your `DSDT` to add the `RMDT` device, you can use this SSDT and refer to the methods with External. See `ACPIDebug.kext` documentation for more information regarding the RMDT methods.|
|**XOSI**|This SSDT provides the `XOSI` method, which is a replacement for the system provided `_OSI` object when the `_OSI to XOSI` patch is being used. This is actually one of the examples in the Clover ACPI hotpatch guide, linked above.|
|**IGPU**| This SSDT injects Intel GPU properties depending on the configuration data in `SSDT-RMCF` and the device-id that is discovered to be present on the system. It assumes the IGPU is named IGPU (typical it's GFX0, requring GFX0 to IGPU rename). Configured with RMCF.TYPE, RMCF.HIGH, RMCF.IGPI, and SSDT-SKLSPF.aml.
|**SKLSPF**|Optional SSDT that can be paired with `SSDT-IGPU`. When present, SSDT-IGPU uses its data as overrides for various Kaby Lake iGPUs to spoof them as Skylake devices. Prior to 10.12.6, Skylake spoofing was the only option for Kaby Lake graphics to work. Keep in mind that complete Skylake spoofing required `FakePCIID.kext` and `FakePCIID_Intel_HD_Graphics.kext`.</br> **NOTE**: This is completely irrelevant nowadays, since Kaby Lake has been fully supported eversince the first release of these configs in 2018!
|**IMEI**|This SSDT injects fake device-id as required for IMEI when using mixed HD3000/7-series or HD4000/6-series. Be sure to read the comments within carefully, as customization is required if your system already has an IMEI identity in ACPI.
|**PNLF**|This SSDT injects a PNLF device that works with `IntelBacklight.kext` or `AppleBacklight.kext`. Configured with RMCF.BKLT, RMCF.LMAX, RMCF.FBTP. See [Laptop backlight control using AppleBacklightFixup.kext](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-laptop-backlight-control-using-applebacklightinjector-kext.218222/)
|**LPC**| This SSDT injects properties to force AppleLPC to load for various unsupported LPC device-ids. It assumes the LPC device is named LPCB.
|**SATA**| This SSDT injects properties (fake device-id, compatible) to enable the SATA controller with certain unsupported SATA controllers.  It assumes the SATA device is named SATA (typical is SAT0, thus requiring SAT0->SATA rename).
|**DDGPU**| This SSDT provides an `_INI` method that will call `_OFF` for a couple of common paths for a discrete GPU in a switched/dual GPU scenario.This SSDT can work to disable the Nvidia or AMD graphics device, if the path matches (or is modified to math) and your `_OFF` method code path has no EC related code. Refer to the hotpatch guide for a complete example.
|**SMBUS**| This SSDT injects the missing DVL0 device.  Mostly used with Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge systems.
|**GPRW, UPRW**| This SSDT is used in conjuction with the `GPRW to XPRW` or `UPRW to XPRW` patch. Used together this SSDT can fix "instant-wake" by disabling "wake on USB". It overrides the `_PRW` package return for GPE indexes 0x0d or 0x6d. Potential companion patches are provided in hotpatch/config.plist
|**LANCPRW**| Also part of fixing "instant wake", but this is for `_PRW` on the Ethernet device. Potential companion patches are provided in hotpatch/config.plist.
|**PTSWAK**| This SSDT provides overrides for both `_PTS` and `_WAK` methods. When combined with the appropriate companion patches from hotpatch/config.plist, these methods can provide various fixes. The actions are controlled by RMCF.DPTS, RMCF.SHUT, RMCF.XPEE, RMCF.SSTF. Refer to SSDT-RMCF.dsl for more information on those options.
|**DEHCI**| This SSDT can disable both EHCI controllers. It is assumed both have been renamed to EH01/EH02 (typically original names are EHC1/EHC2) 
|**DEH01/DEH02**| Each of these SSDTs is just SSDT-DEHCI.dsl broken down to only disable EH01 or only EH02. Use as appropriate depending on which EHCI controllers are active/present in your ACPI set. 
|**XWAK, XSEL, ESEL**| Each of these SSDTs provides an empty XWAK, XSEL, and ESEL methods (respectively). Use with the appropriate companion patch from hotpatch/config.plist. Typically, these methods are disabled (by having no code in them) to disable certain actions native ACPI may be doing on wake from sleep or during startup that cause problems with the xHCI/EHCI configuration.
|**SSDT-XCPM**| This SSDT injects "plugin-type"=1 on CPU0. It assumes ACPI Processor objects are in Scope `_PR`. It can be used to enable native CPU power management on Haswell and later CPUs. See [Native Power Management for Laptops](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-native-power-management-for-laptops.175801/) 
|**HDEF/HDAU**| Injects layout-id, hda-gfx, and PinConfiguration properties on HDEF and HDAU in order to implement audio with patched AppleHDA.kext Configured with: RMCF.AUDL
|**EH01, EH02, XHC**| These SSDTs inject USB power properties and control over FakePCIID_XHCIMux (depending on SSDT-DEH*.dsl).
|**ALS0**| Injects a fake Ambient Light Sensor which fixes problems with restoring brightness upon reboot.
