# Converting OpenCore Properties to Clover
>Work In Progress!

This is for users planning to convert their working OpenCore Config to Clover. It’s an adaptation of the [**Clover Conversion Guide**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/tree/master/clover-conversion) – just the other way around.

## ACPI
In general, you can use the same SSDTs (.aml) in Clover as in OpenCore. But since Clover has a lot of built-in DSDT Patches, some of then (and accompanying renames required to make them work in OC) are unnecessary.

### ACPI > Add
Following is an incomplete list of .aml files not needed in Clover, since it provides DSDT `Fixes` for them:

- `SSDT-SBUS-MCHC.aml`&rarr; Use Fixes`AddMCHC`and`FixSBUS`instead
- `SSDT-HPET.aml` → Use Fixes `FixTMR`, `FixIPIC` and `FixHPET` instead. You also don’t need the accompanying rename `change_CRS to XCRS` which is required in OpenCore.
- `DTGP` doesn't have to be part of SSDT patches. It will be generated by activating `AddDTGP`
- … 

### ACPI > Delete
The ACPI > Delete section is meant for deleting certain Tables from ACPI (usually combined with other SSDTs to replace them, like SSDT-PM or SSDT-PLUG for example). 

In Clover Configurator, this section is located under ACPI > Drop Tables. These are the available Paramters:

| OpenCore        | Clover              |
|:----------------|:--------------------|
| Table Signature | Signature           |
| OEMTableID      | Type/Key > TableID  |
| TableLength     | Type/Key > Length   |
| All             | DropForAllOS        |
| Enabled         | Disabled            |
| Comment         | –                 |

**Example**: Dropping CPU Power Management tables

- In Clover Configurator:</br>

**NOTES**:

- In Clover, you enter actual names whereas in OpenCore you have to use HEX values.
- In Clover, you have to decide bewteen using either `TableID` or `TableLength`, not both.

### ACPI > Patch
While Binary Renames work the same in OpenCore and Clover, you have a lot more options in OpenCore:

| OpenCore        | Clover    |
|:---------------:|:----------:|
| Comment         | Comment   |
| Find		        | Find      |
| Replace         | Replace   |
| Base            | use [TgtBridge](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Clover-Crate/tree/main/ACPI#tgtbridge) instead|
| Enabled         | Disabled  |
| Table Signature | –       |
| OEMTableID      | –       |  
| TableLength     | –       |
| Mask            | –       |
| ReplaceMask     | –       |
| Count           | –       |
| Limit           | –       | 
| Skip            | –       |
| BaseSkip        | –       |

In Clover you also have the option "RenameDevices" which works the same as the `Base` Parameter in OpenCore with the difference that it is limited to devices:

In OCAT:
![](/Users/kl45u5/Desktop/OCAT_base.png)

### ACPI > Quirks 

| OpenCore          | Clover      |
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| FadtEnableReset   | HaltEnabler |
| Normalize Headers | FixHeaders  |
| Reset Logo Status | ?           |
| Rebase Regions    | ?           |
| Reset HwSig			| ?           |
| SyncTableIDs      | ?           |

## DeviceProperties vs Devices > Properties
In OCAT, devices are added or modified in a straight forward "DeviceProperties" section:
![](/Users/kl45u5/Desktop/OCAT_Devprops.png)
In Clover Configurator these are hidden bedind a button in a sub-section:
![Devices](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/138610651-c9d42248-d1b8-4e54-b16a-2819556ae60f.png)
Besides that they work the same and the data is interchangeable.

## Kernel
For users who want to convert their Kext and Kernel Patches from OpenCore to Clover. Note that Clover uses two different sections for patching: one for patching Kexts ("KextsToPatch") and one for Patching the Kernel (KernelToPatch), whereas in OpenCore this is handled in the same section ("Kernel > Patch"). 

### Kernel > Patch
In Clover Configurator, you have enter the values in Kernel and Kext Patches Section. In the table below you find the availabe options and differences in nomenclature:

| OpenCore    | Clover         |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
| Identifier  | Name           |
| Base        | Procedure      |
| Comment     | Comment        |
| Find		    | Find           |
| Replace     | Replace        |
| Mask        | MaskFind       |
| ReplaceMask | MaskReplace    |
| –           | MaskStart      |
| –           | StartPattern   |
| –           | RangeFind      |
| MinKernel  | –°           |
| MaxKernel  | –°           |
| Count       | Count          |
| Limit       | –            |
| Skip        | Skip           |
| Enabled     | Disabled       |
| Arch        | –            |
| –         | MatchOS°       |
| –         | InfoPlistPatch |
| –         | RangeFind      |

`°` Although there are no equivalents to `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` parameters in Clover, you could use `MatcOS`. Instead of a range of kernel versions you just use the macOS version(s) it applies to. For example: `10.13,10.14,10.15` (without blanks in between).

### Kernel > Quirks
Most of OpenCore's Kernel Patches are located in Clover's Quirks Section, but the following are located under Kernel and Kext Patches:

| OpenCore (Kernel > Quirks) | Clover (Kernel and Kext Patches)|
|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|AppleCpuPmCfgLock           | AppleIntelCPUPM
|AppleXcpmCfgLock            | KernelPM
|AppleXcpmExtraMsrs          | KernelXCPM
|CustomSMBIOSGuid            | DellSMBIOSPatch
|DisableRtcChecksum          | AppleRTC
|LapicKernelPanic            | Kernel LAPIC
|PanicNoKextDump             | PanicNoKextDump
