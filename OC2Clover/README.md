# Converting OpenCore Properties to Clover
>Work In Progress!

This is for users planning to convert their working OpenCore Config to Clover. It’s an adaptation of the [**Clover Conversion Guide**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/tree/master/clover-conversion) – just the other way around.

## ACPI
In general, you can use the same SSDTs (.aml) in Clover as in OpenCore. But since Clover has a lot of built-in DSDT Patches, some of then (and accompanying renames required to make them work in OC) are unnecessary.

### ACPI > Add
Following is an incomplete list of .aml files not needed in Clover, since it provides DSDT `Fixes` for them:

- `SSDT-SBUS-MCHC.aml`&rarr;UseFixes`AddMCHC`and`FixSBUS`instead
- `SSDT-HPET.aml` → Use Fixes `FixTMR`, `FixIPIC` and `FixHPET` instead. You also don’t need the accompanying rename `change_CRS to XCRS` which is required in OpenCore.
- `DTGP` doesn't have to be part of SSDT patches. It will be generated by activating `AddDTGP`

### ACPI > Patches

#### Renaming Mask Differences OpenCore vs Clover

For users who want to "convert" their ACPI Renames from OpenCore to Clover or vice versa. Note that in Clover Configurator Renaming rules and dropping SSDTs are split into 2 sections, whereas in OpenCore it's handled by one mask.

| OpenCore        | Clover         |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Table Signature | Signature ("Drop Tables") |
| OEMTableID      | TableID ("Drop Tables" > "Type/Key") |
| TableLength     | Length ("Drop Tables" > "Type/Key") |
| N/A             | DropForAllOS ("Drop Tables") |
| Find		        | Find           |
| Replace         | Replace        |
| Comment         | Comment        |
| Mask            | N/A            |
| ReplaceMask     | N/A            |
| Count           | N/A            |
| Limit           | N/A            | 
| Skip            | N/A            |
| Enabled         | Disabled       |
| Base            | TgtBridge      |
| BaseSkip        | N/A            |
 
### ACPI > Quirks 

| OpenCore          | Clover      |
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| FadtEnableReset   | HaltEnabler |
| Normalize Headers | FixHeaders  |
| Reset Logo Status | ?           |
| Rebase Regions    | ?           |
| Reset HwSig			| ?           |
| SyncTableIDs      | ?           |

## DeviceProperties vs Devices > Properties
In OpenCore, devices are added or modified in th straight forward "DeviceProperties" section, whereas in Clover Configurator these are hidden bedind a button in a weird convoluted sub-section which itself is split into two:

Besides that they work the same and the data is interchangeable.

## Kernel and Kext Patches

#### Replacement Mask Differences
For users who want to convert their Kext and Kernel Patches from OpenCore to Clover or vice versa

| OpenCore    | Clover         |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| Identifier  | Name           |
| Base        | Procedure      |
| Comment     | Comment        |
| Find		    | Find           |
| Replace     | Replace        |
| Mask        | MaskFind       |
| ReplaceMask | MaskReplace    |
| MinKernel   | N/A            |
| MaxKernel   | N/A            |
| Count       | Count          |
| Limit       | N/A
| Skip        | Skip           |
| Enabled     | Disabled       |
| Arch        | N/A
| N/A         | MatchOS	        |
| N/A         | InfoPlistPatch |
| N/A         | RangeFind      |

### Kext Patches
Most of OpenCore's Kernel Patches are located in Clover's Quirks Section, but the following are located under Kernel and Kext Patches:

| OpenCore (Kernel > Quirks) | Clover (Kernel and Kext Patches)|
|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|AppleCpuPmCfgLock           | AppleIntelCPUPM
|AppleXcpmCfgLock            | KernelPM
|AppleXcpmExtraMsrs          | KernelXCPM
|CustomSMBIOSGuid            | DellSMBIOSPatch
|DisableRtcChecksum          | AppleRTC
|LapicKernelPanic            | Kernel LAPIC
|PanicNoKextDump             | PanicNoKextDump
