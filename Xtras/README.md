# Clover Calculators Spreadsheet

This section includes a spreadsheet for Apple Numbers and MS Excel for calculating correct values for `csr-active-config`, `BooterConfig` and `Darkwake`. 

If you are looking for an actual tool to calculate these things (and more), you should check out CorpNewt's [**BitmaskDecode**](https://github.com/corpnewt/BitmaskDecode)

There's also an online [**ScanPolicy Calculator**](https://oc-scanpolicy.vercel.app/)
